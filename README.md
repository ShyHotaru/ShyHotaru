> A shy imagination becomes a star that shines.  
>
> Sometimes, I have dreams and ideas that feel too whimsical to say out loud—  
> the kind that might make others laugh or brush off as foolish.  
> I call those **shy imaginations**.  
>  
> When the Wright brothers dreamed of flying,  
> it must have been a shy imagination too—one that eventually changed the world.  
>  
> Just like that dream, shining like a star,  
> I believe shy imagination has the power to light up the world one day.  
>
> **ShyStella** is a brand built on that philosophy.  
> I turn whimsical, dream-like ideas into reality—one by one.
